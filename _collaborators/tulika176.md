### Biography
Tulika Bose is a Professor of Physics at University of Wisconsin-Madison, a Fellow of the American Physical Society, and a member of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).  Bose received her B.A. from Cambridge University and her Ph.D. from Columbia University.
Bose is currently serving as the Deputy U.S. CMS Software & Computing Operations Program Manager and previously served as the CMS Physics Co-coordinator (2017-2019) and the CMS Trigger Co-coordinator (2014-2016). Bose is a recipient of the Alfred P. Sloan fellowship and a CMS Distinguished Researcher award. She is currently the Secretary/Treasurer for the APS Division of Particles and Fields (DPF), a member of Particle Physics Project Prioritization Panel (P5), and has previously served on the APS/DPF Executive Committee, the Fermilab Usersâ€™ Executive Committee, and the US LHC Users Association Executive Committee.  Bose has a keen interest in outreach, science communication and improving diversity and inclusion. She co-organizes the U.S. CMS PURSUE program for minoritized undergraduate students, is on the Advisory Committee for Symmetry magazine, is currently the chair of the Physics Department Climate & Diversity committee and a member of the University Faculty Senate.  


### Project interests
Bose has a keen interest in modernization of CMS software and computing infrastructure via the integration of heterogenous computing resources (e.g. GPUs). Her team at UW-Madison is currently working to port CMS reconstruction code to GPUs and integrate GPU-based workflows within the CMS computing system. Her group is also making important contributions to the CMS High-Level Trigger and is engaged in the development of innovative analysis facilities for the High-Luminosity LHC.
