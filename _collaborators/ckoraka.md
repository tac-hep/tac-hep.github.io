### Biography
Charis-Kleio Koraka is a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Physics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She earned her Ph.D. in Physics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens studying the associated production of the Higgs boson with a top and anti-top quark pair. She has been a member of the CMS experiment since 2018 also working with the electron and photon Level-1 trigger group. Currently, her focus is on extending the usage of GPUs in the CMS experiment in light of the high luminosity running phase of the LHC (HL-LHC). She was involved in the commissioning and integration of the GPU cluster at the Wisconsin Tier-2 facility with the CMS production system. Charis is also working on developing an accelerator friendly version of the CMS electron reconstruction code. She is also engaged in physics analysis, searching for Vector-Like Leptons, well-motivated particles predicted by Beyond the Standard Model theories. 
 
### Project interests
