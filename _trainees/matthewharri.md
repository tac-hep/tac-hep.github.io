### Biography
 
 I am a third year graduate student currently working in the UMass Amherst ATLAS group, advised by Stephane Willocq. 

### Project interests
 
 I currently work on ACTS (A Common Tracking Software) developing a prototype navigation model for the ATLAS muon spectrometer that could potentially be used for HL-LHC. I also work on a standard model VH physics analysis, more precisely WH(WW) with a three lepton final state.
