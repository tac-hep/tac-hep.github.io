    I am working on the set up and configuration of an analysis facility at UW-Madison. This work is being 
    done in collaboration with scientists at Fermilab and University of Nebraska/IRIS-HEP. Plans include installing 
    JupyterHub, as well as configuring distributed computing access to the UW-Madison both CPU and GPU resources at 
    the CMS Tier-2 and the Center for High Throughput Computing facility. I am investigating the use of HT-Condor 
    and Kubernetes. Once functional, I will be working on an LHC physics analysis that exploits the resources and motivates
    further facility development.

### Biography

I am a first-year graduate student at the University of Wisconsin - Madison, working in the CMS group and advised by Professor Sridhara Dasu.

My interests include harnessing computational power and statistical/machine learning techniques to capitalize on the wealth of data produced in modern and future particle physics experiments.
