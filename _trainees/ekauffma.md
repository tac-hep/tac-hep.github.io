### Biography
I am a second-year graduate student at Princeton University working in the CMS group and advised by Prof. Isobel Ojalvo. Previously I was working with IRIS-HEP.

### Project interests
I am interested in how the field of high energy physics motivates advances in computing. I am currently working on anomaly detection using machine learning in the CMS L1 Trigger.
