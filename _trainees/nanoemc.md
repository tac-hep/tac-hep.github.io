### Biography and Project Description

I am a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working on a PhD in High Energy Experimental Particle Physics with the CMS. I currently work on the Elastic Analysis Facility (EAF) hosted at Fermilab. It is part of the R&D effort to develop high performing analysis tools that we can use for HL-LHC and generally for other future experiments. Specifically I work on developing the Dask setup and system that integrates with Fermilabâ€™s HTCondor system. I hope to improve the way we use Dask so that we can sustain and support many users in an easy to implement way. Other tasks I work on are benchmarking for the EAF, acting as a liaison between the EAF and IRIS-HEP, and I generally aid and support as a member of the EAF applications team. 

#### Recent Accomplishments
- [Demonstration Video of the EAF](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1291680/contributions/5581053/attachments/2714147/4713730/EAF_Demo_Video_with_audio.mp4) - Combination of the work described, produced for the AGC Demonstration Day
- [User Documentation for EAF (early version)](https://eafjupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/00_getting_started.html) - Early versions of the EAF user documentation, since the EAF is R&D it needs to be updated
- Successfully adapted AGC Notebook to EAF
- Aided in Stabilizing Dask Set-up
- Adapted Coffea Exercises to EAF
