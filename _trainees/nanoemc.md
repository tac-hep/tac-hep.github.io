  I work on developing applications for Fermilab's Elastic Analysis Facility (EAF) with Burt Holtzman and Maria Acosta Flechas. Analysis facilities are 
  spaces for researchers to write and run analysis code without needing to configure their personal computers which helps with portability and 
  performance. As such, another part of my project is ensuring that physicists and other users have their needs met and that the EAF runs smoothly 
  on for the user. I also help develop user-friendly documentation.
